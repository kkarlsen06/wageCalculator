# isWageCaregiver Refactor Summary

## Overview
Removed the `isWageCaregiver` flag from the codebase and replaced its functionality with enterprise subscription checks. The system now determines wage caregiver capabilities based on whether the user has an active subscription with tier = "max" in the `subscription_tiers` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Utility Module
- **File**: `kalkulator/js/subscriptionUtils.js` (created)
- **Purpose**: Centralized subscription checking logic
- **Key Functions**:
  - `hasEnterpriseSubscription()`: Checks if user has active "max" tier subscription
  - `getCurrentSubscriptionState()`: Gets current subscription state

### 2. Updated Main Application Logic
- **File**: `kalkulator/js/appLogic.js` (modified)
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `isWageCaregiver` property from app state
  - Removed `isWageCaregiver` from all settings save/load operations
  - Updated UI toggle functions to be read-only and subscription-based
  - Made relevant methods async to handle subscription checks
  - Updated tab visibility logic to use enterprise subscription check

### 3. Specific Method Updates
- `onOrgWageCaregiverToggle()`: Now checks subscription and shows upgrade message
- `updateOrgSettingsUI()`: Made async, uses enterprise subscription check
- `updateTabBarVisibility()`: Made async, uses enterprise subscription check  
- `toggleWageCaregiver()`: Now read-only, shows upgrade message for non-enterprise users
- Removed `isWageCaregiver` from localStorage and Supabase persistence

### 4. UI Behavior Changes
- Wage caregiver toggles are now disabled (read-only)
- Toggle state reflects current enterprise subscription status
- Users without enterprise subscription see upgrade messages
- "Ansatte" (Employees) tab visibility controlled by subscription tier
- Organization settings (break policies) controlled by subscription tier

## Database Impact

### Before
- User preferences stored `is_wage_caregiver` boolean flag in `user_settings` table
- Flag determined access to wage caregiver features

### After  
- No changes to database schema required
- System checks `subscription_tiers.tier = 'max'` AND `subscription_tiers.is_active = true`
- Old `is_wage_caregiver` columns can be safely removed from `user_settings` table

## Migration Notes
- No data migration required - functionality seamlessly switches to subscription-based
- Existing users with `isWageCaregiver = true` will need enterprise subscription for continued access
- UI automatically updates to reflect current subscription status
- Build process verified - no syntax errors

## Testing
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Development server starts without errors  
- ✅ All async method calls properly updated
- ✅ Import statements added correctly

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Logic**: Single source of truth for enterprise features
2. **Revenue Model**: Aligns feature access with subscription tiers
3. **Consistency**: All premium features controlled by subscription status
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized subscription logic in utility module
