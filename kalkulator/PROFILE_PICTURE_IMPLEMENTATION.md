# Profile Picture Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the profile picture feature for the wage calculator application. The feature allows users to upload, compress, and display profile pictures with full integration into Supabase Storage.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Profile Picture Upload in Modal
- Added file input component to the existing profile modal
- Supports JPG, JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats
- Visual preview of current profile picture
- Upload and remove buttons with proper styling

### ✅ 2. Client-Side Image Compression
- Automatic resizing to maximum 400x400px while maintaining aspect ratio
- Compression to under 500KB target size
- Progressive quality reduction if needed
- Maintains high image quality with smart compression

### ✅ 3. Supabase Storage Integration
- Secure file upload to dedicated 'profile-pictures' bucket
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user access control
- Automatic cleanup of old profile pictures when updated
- Public URL generation for image display

### ✅ 4. Top Bar Integration
- Replaces placeholder profile icon with user's uploaded picture
- Maintains existing button functionality and hover effects
- Circular image display with proper sizing (32x32px)
- Smooth transitions and loading states

### ✅ 5. Fallback Handling
- Graceful fallback to placeholder icon when no picture is set
- Error handling for failed image loads
- Loading states during upload process
- Progress indication with percentage and status text

### ✅ 6. Database Schema
- Added `profile_picture_url` column to `user_settings` table
- Created storage bucket with proper RLS policies
- Indexed for performance optimization

### ✅ 7. Visual Consistency
- Circular profile pictures throughout the UI
- Consistent hover effects and transitions
- Proper sizing and border styling
- Matches existing design patterns

## Required Database Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Run the following SQL statements in your Supabase SQL editor before using the feature:

```sql
-- 1. Create storage bucket for profile pictures
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('profile-pictures', 'profile-pictures', true);

-- 2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures');

-- 3. Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Add profile_picture_url column to user_settings table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'user_settings' 
        AND column_name = 'profile_picture_url'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE user_settings 
        ADD COLUMN profile_picture_url TEXT;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- 5. Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_settings_profile_picture_url 
ON user_settings(profile_picture_url);
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `kalkulator/js/imageUtils.js` - Image compression and processing utilities
- `kalkulator/sql/profile_picture_setup.sql` - Complete database setup script

### Modified Files:
- `kalkulator/app.html` - Added profile picture upload component to profile modal
- `kalkulator/css/style.css` - Added styling for profile picture components
- `kalkulator/js/appLogic.js` - Added profile picture management methods

## Technical Details

### Image Compression Process:
1. File validation (type, size)
2. Canvas-based resizing with aspect ratio preservation
3. Progressive JPEG compression with quality adjustment
4. Target: ≤500KB, ≤400x400px

### Storage Structure:
- Bucket: `profile-pictures`
- File path: `{user_id}/profile_{timestamp}_{random}.jpg`
- Public access for viewing, user-restricted for upload/delete

### Security Features:
- RLS policies ensure users can only manage their own pictures
- File type validation on client and server
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned files
- Secure URL generation

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Open profile modal from top navigation
2. Click "Velg bilde" to select an image file
3. Image is automatically compressed and uploaded
4. Profile picture appears in top navigation immediately
5. Use "Fjern" button to remove profile picture

### For Developers:
1. Run the SQL setup script in Supabase
2. Verify the storage bucket and policies are created
3. Test upload/download functionality
4. Monitor storage usage and cleanup as needed

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid file types or sizes
- Network connectivity issues
- Storage quota exceeded
- Image processing failures
- Database update errors

All errors are displayed to users with clear Norwegian messages and logged to console for debugging.

## Performance Considerations

- Client-side compression reduces server load and storage costs
- Progressive image loading with opacity transitions
- Efficient caching with proper cache headers
- Indexed database queries for fast profile picture retrieval
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat

## Browser Compatibility

The feature uses modern web APIs:
- Canvas API for image processing
- File API for file handling
- Fetch API for uploads
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout

Supported browsers: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+
