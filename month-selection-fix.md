# Month Selection Fix

## Problem
The web page was saving the selected month state to both localStorage and Supabase, causing the app to remember the previously selected month instead of always defaulting to the current month on page load.

## Root Cause
The `currentMonth` property was being persisted in multiple places:
1. **localStorage settings** - saved when settings changed
2. **Supabase settings** - saved when settings changed  
3. **Form state in localStorage** - saved when form inputs changed
4. **Restored on page load** - from both localStorage and Supabase

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed currentMonth from `changeMonth()` function
```javascript
// Before: Saved form state and settings when month changed
changeMonth(month) {
    this.currentMonth = month;
    this.saveFormState(); // ❌ REMOVED
    this.updateDisplay(true);
    this.populateDateGrid();
    this.saveSettingsToSupabase(); // ❌ REMOVED
}

// After: Only updates display, doesn't persist
changeMonth(month) {
    this.currentMonth = month;
    this.updateDisplay(true);
    this.populateDateGrid();
    // Note: Don't save currentMonth to settings
}
```

### 2. Removed currentMonth from Supabase settings
```javascript
// Before: Saved currentMonth to database
if ('current_month' in existingSettings) settingsData.current_month = this.currentMonth;
settingsData.current_month = this.currentMonth;

// After: Removed both instances
// Remove currentMonth from settings - it should always default to current month on page load
```

### 3. Removed currentMonth from localStorage settings
```javascript
// Before: Saved currentMonth to localStorage
const data = {
    // ... other settings
    currentMonth: this.currentMonth,
    // ... more settings
};

// After: Removed from saved data
const data = {
    // ... other settings
    // Remove currentMonth from localStorage - it should always default to current month on page load
    // ... more settings
};
```

### 4. Always set currentMonth to current month on load
```javascript
// Before: Loaded saved currentMonth from localStorage
this.currentMonth = data.currentMonth || new Date().getMonth() + 1;

// After: Always defaults to current month
this.currentMonth = new Date().getMonth() + 1; // Always default to current month
```

### 5. Removed currentMonth from form state
```javascript
// Before: Saved currentMonth in form state
const formState = {
    // ... other form fields
    currentMonth: this.currentMonth
};

// After: Removed from form state
const formState = {
    // ... other form fields
    // Remove currentMonth from form state - it should always default to current month on page load
};
```

### 6. Removed currentMonth restoration logic
```javascript
// Before: Restored currentMonth from form state
if (formState.currentMonth && formState.currentMonth !== new Date().getMonth() + 1) {
    this.currentMonth = formState.currentMonth;
    // ... update UI logic
}

// After: Removed restoration logic
// Remove currentMonth restoration - it should always default to current month on page load
```

## Result
Now the web page will:
- ✅ Always load showing the current month
- ✅ Allow users to navigate to other months during their session
- ✅ Reset to the current month on every page refresh/reload
- ✅ Not remember the previously selected month

The fix ensures that the expected behavior is implemented: the page always defaults to the current month on load, regardless of what month the user was viewing before refreshing the page.
